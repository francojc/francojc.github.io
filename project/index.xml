      <description>ACTIV-ES is a comparable Spanish corpus comprised of tv/film dialogue from Argentine, Mexican and Spanish productions. Titles for each of these three countries were seeded from the Internet Movie Database, subtitle data for the hearing impaired was provided by Opensubtitles.org and was post-processed to correct/remove subtitle, OCR and diacritic artifacts and annotated for part-of-speech.
The data is available in two main formats: 1) running text for each document and 2) 1:5 gram aggregate files.</description>

      <description>Aim In recent years there has been a growing buzz around the term &amp;lsquo;Data Science&amp;rsquo;, and related terms, data analytics, data mining, etc. In a nutshell data science is the process by which an investigator leverages statistical methods and computational power to uncover insight from large datasets. Driven in large part by the increase in computing power available to the average individual and the increasing amount of electronic data that is now available through the internet, interest in data science has expanded to virtually all fields in academia and areas in the public sector.</description>
