While searching for [code examples in R for creating word clouds](http://www.r-bloggers.com/abstract-word-clouds-using-r), I stumbled across this neat tool to create on-the-fly word clouds. [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/) provides a clean and basic interface to creating your own wordle or browsing others made on the site.

Here's a cloud I created based on the Mexican film [Y tu mamá también](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245574/) from 2001.

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(EBImage)
img <- readImage(files = "images/y-tu-mama.png")
display(img)
```

You can create your own wordle [here](http://www.wordle.net/create)
