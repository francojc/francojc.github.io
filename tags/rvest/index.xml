      <description>Web scraping There are many resources available through direct downloads from repositories and individual sites and R package interfaces to web resources with APIs, but these resources are relatively limited to the amount of public-facing textual data recorded on the web. In the case that you want to acquire data from webpages R can be used to access the web programmatically through a process known as web scraping. The complexity of web scrapes can vary but in general it requires more advanced knowledge of R as well as the structure of the language of the web: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).</description>

      <description>In this ExploRation, I will demonstrate how to scrape text data from the web with R. This particular example aims to collect a series of State of the Union (SOTU) speeches [1947-present] from http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ and write the plain-text contents to disc. The bulk of the work will be done with the recently released rvest package. The scripting will also employ the magrittr package for writing legible code.
To get started first we identify the sub-page .</description>
