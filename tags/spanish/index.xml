      <description>Web scraping There are many resources available through direct downloads from repositories and individual sites and R package interfaces to web resources with APIs, but these resources are relatively limited to the amount of public-facing textual data recorded on the web. In the case that you want to acquire data from webpages R can be used to access the web programmatically through a process known as web scraping. The complexity of web scrapes can vary but in general it requires more advanced knowledge of R as well as the structure of the language of the web: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).</description>

      <description>ACTIV-ES is a comparable Spanish corpus comprised of tv/film dialogue from Argentine, Mexican and Spanish productions. Titles for each of these three countries were seeded from the Internet Movie Database, subtitle data for the hearing impaired was provided by Opensubtitles.org and was post-processed to correct/remove subtitle, OCR and diacritic artifacts and annotated for part-of-speech.
The data is available in two main formats: 1) running text for each document and 2) 1:5 gram aggregate files.</description>
