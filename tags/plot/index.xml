      <description>This is a post to test the functionality of blogdown. We are going to look at how various types of outputs are rendered and do some tweaking to get things to work right. The hope is to get an idea of what the best practices for creating posts and pages is when working with this software.
Tables Here’s some more code working with tables with different functions.</description>

      <description>Not all tweets have geolocation information available. Accessing the Twitter API via the streamR package particular parameters can be set to only include those tweets with geolocation enabled. You can also specify a bounding box to further filter the geographic area from which you would like to draw your sample tweets. Now, the bounding box is going to be just that, a box. And we are dealing with polygons. To isolate tweets from a specific geo-political region, such as a census tract, you can use the sp package.</description>

      <description>I’m currently working on a project involving Twitter posts and demographics. One of the best resources for demographic information in the US is the census. Having not worked with US census data in a very long time, I was excited to see that there is an R package available to make the process easier.
In this exploRation I will provide a tutorial on 1) how to acquire the US census data and other demographic data through American Fact Finder, 2) how to visualize the data in regional choropleths, 3) how to overlay geo-tagged tweets, and finally 4) how to display the map as an interactive plot.</description>

      <title>Creating hexbin plots</title>

      <description>I was just browsing the web today and stumbled on an overview of data visualization in R. As I was scrolling the page something caught my eye: a hexbin plot. I had never heard of such a plot before.
To create a hexbin plot in base R with plot() you need to install the hexbin package.
install.packages(&amp;quot;hexbin&amp;quot;) Then you can load the library and create your hexbin object setting x and y.</description>

      <description>While searching for code examples in R for creating word clouds, I stumbled across this neat tool to create on-the-fly word clouds. Wordle provides a clean and basic interface to creating your own wordle or browsing others made on the site.
Here’s a cloud I created based on the Mexican film Y tu mamá también from 2001.
You can create your own wordle here</description>
