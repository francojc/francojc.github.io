      <description>ACTIV-ES is a comparable Spanish corpus comprised of tv/film dialogue from Argentine, Mexican and Spanish productions. Titles for each of these three countries were seeded from the Internet Movie Database, subtitle data for the hearing impaired was provided by Opensubtitles.org and was post-processed to correct/remove subtitle, OCR and diacritic artifacts and annotated for part-of-speech.
The data is available in two main formats: 1) running text for each document and 2) 1:5 gram aggregate files.</description>
