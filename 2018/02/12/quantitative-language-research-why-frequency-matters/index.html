<p>Over the last decades there has been steadily growing interest in applying quantitative approaches (often referred to as Data Science) to a diverse set of practical tasks and theoretical questions in and outside of academia across a diverse set of fields. This growth has been fueled in large part by increasing access to machine readable data, advances in statistical modeling, and increased computing power. Interest in the quantitative properties of language, common in the early 20th century, declined after a significant paradigm shift in the mid-20th century. Decades later tangible advances in language engineering tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, and search algorithms, however, have inspired researchers to take a fresh look at applying quantitative methods to theoretical language research. In this post I consider the growing evidence that frequency plays a significant role in language use and balance these findings with areas of language research where quantitative methods have yet to make inroads.</p>
<div id="have-you-heard-the-buzz" class="section level2">
<h2>Have you heard the buzz?</h2>
<!-- Increasing use of quantitative methods in a wide variety of fields -->
<p>Quantitative research is on the rise. Whether in industry and academics there are ever fewer domains where quantitative data analysis has not made significant inroads. This growth is in larger part due to the overwhelming increase in the amount of machine readable data available, sometimes referred to as the ‘data deluge’. Data alone, however, is not enough. To turn data into insight it takes computing skills, knowledge of statistics, and domain expertise <a href="#fig:data-science-venn">1</a>.</p>
<!-- It takes a Increased accessibility to computing resources and maturity of statistical procedures has paved the way for researchers to turn the 'data deluge' into insight.  -->

<p>The nexus between these three areas has produced some well-known language applications <a href="#fig:language-applications">2</a>. From the language-capable personal assistant applications, plagarism detection software, machine translation and search, tangible results of quantitative approaches to language are becoming standard fixtures in our lives.</p>

<!-- - Some notable current research in language -->
<p>For the academic, quantitative approaches are also making waves. Long-standing questions and questions which once did not seem feasible are being tackled in wide range of fields, including studies of language and linguistics.</p>
<!-- from language use, applied areas -->
<p>Language variation and change
Mapping the geographical diffusion of new words (Eisenstein, 2012)</p>
<p>Cultural anthropology
Temporal patterns of happiness and information in a global social network: hedonometrics and Twitter. (Dodds et al., 2011)</p>
<p>Literary analysis
The emotional arcs of stories are dominated by six basic shapes (Reagan et al., 2016)</p>
<p>Social Psychology
Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases (Caliskan, 2016)</p>
<!-- to the structure of language -->
<p>…</p>
<p>The amount of research is growing and the methods are being refined. The recent progress is due in large part to wider accessibility to powerful computing and to the maturation of statistical methods that have taken place over the last 20 to 30 years, but not exclusively. The availability of computing resources was quite different today than is was in the 1980s. But even if the necessary technology had been available, it is not clear that quantitative research in linguistics would have taken off quite like it has of late. The reason being that the goals and methods of research in linguistics of the 1980s look much like that of the 60s and 70s –ever since an important paradigm shift known as the Cognitive Revolution which was spearheaded by the up and coming linguist Noam Chomsky.</p>
<!-- A short history of approaches to language research -->
<p>Understanding the trajectory of linguistics and cognitive science of the 20th century is key to placing the current boom in quantitive research in context. Early in the century the study of linguistics was primarily engaged in understanding usage patterns. This approach was characterized by the Empirisist tradition of Boas, Zipf, and even Chomsky’s mentor Harris. For the most part linguists and psychologists did not collaborate. Each field developed in isolation from one another. The work B.F. Skinner was an important exception. His book Verbal Behavior outlined an approach to language which adopted the primary framework in psychology at the time –Behaviorism. In essence, Skinner suggested that language is a conditioned behavior in which a linguistic context formed a stimulus and the linguistic reaction to the context, the response. In this way stimulus-response pairs were either reinforced by desired outcomes or inhibited when the desired outcome was not acheived. This approach underscored two key aspects to language behavior: (1) that linguistic behavior is meaning based and (2) that the frequency of usage patterns was key to understanding linguistic form. This particular approach to language behavior, in line with reasoning in behaviorist psychology, also negated the role of an internal linguistic state; that is, the role of the mind was to store stimulus-response pairs and relay appropriate responses to given linguistic contexts.</p>
<!-- In the same year Noam Chomsky published ... soon the two approaches would collide and the result would have important implications for the direction of linguistics and psychology --leading to the field of cognitive science. -->
<p>In 1957 published a ground-breaking manuscript entitled “Syntactic Structures”. In this work Chomsky outlined the basic framework for what would become known as Generative Grammar. His approach was a decidely scientific approach to language for the times emphazising combinatorial properties of language to explain language creativity and recontextualizing the goals of language study: namely to build a formal description, or grammar, of a language that could account for the distinction between observed grammatical structures and unobserved ungrammatical structures. Chomsky suggested that this approach would provide a sound basis for uncovering the abstract properties that govern the possible structures of a particular language and then, applied to other languages, could reveal those those abstractions human languages share. Although not directly addressed in this work, this approach would soon make important claims to as to the status of mental representations of language and ultimately their acquisition.</p>
<ul>
<li>linguistic introspection: negative data (unobserved), contrasted to positive data (observed) to flesh out a more detailed picture of the grammar.</li>
<li>grammars are meaning independent: meaning not a prerequisite to language form</li>
<li>grammars were not fundamentally conditioned/ formed by (derived through) usage patterns</li>
</ul>
<!-- it was the status of mental representations which had the most significant impact on linguistics and across psychology ultimately leading to end of the Behaviorist tradition and opening the field of Cognitive Science. -->
