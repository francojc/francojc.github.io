abstract = {Text-based geolocation classifiers often operate with a grid-based view of the world. Predicting document lo- cation of origin based on text content on a geodesic grid is computationally attractive since many standard meth- ods for supervised document classification carry over unchanged to geolocation in the form of predicting a most probable grid cell for a document. However, the grid-based approach suffers from sparse data problems if one wants to improve classification accuracy by mov- ing to smaller cell sizes. In this paper we investigate an enhancement of common methods for determining the geographic point of origin of a text document by kernel density estimation. For geolocation of tweets we obtain a improvements upon non-kernel methods on datasets of U.S. and global Twitter content.},
