  abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of diacritic error detec- tionandrestoration—the taskof identifyingandcorrectingmissingaccents in text. In particular, we evaluate the performance of a simple part-of- speech tagger-based technique comparing it to other established methods for error detection/restoration: unigram frequency, decision lists, discrim- inative classifiers, a machine-translation based method, and grapheme- based approaches. In languages such as Spanish (the focus here), diacritics play a key role in disambiguation and results show that a straightforward modification to an n-gramtagger can be used to achieve good performance in diacritic error identification without resorting toanyspecializedmachin- ery.Ourmethod should be applicable to any languagewhere diacritics dis- tribute comparably and performsimilar roles of disambiguation.},
