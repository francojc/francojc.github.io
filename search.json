    "text": "TL;DR: As a long time R and RStudio fan it was going to take a fantastic IDE to get me to switch. Visual Studio Code is such an IDE. It is a free, open-source, cross-platform code editor that’s strengths are in its extensibility and customizability, integration with Git and GitHub, its support for a wide variety of programming languages (beyond R), and the epic GitHub Copilot AI code completion extension. It’s only main drawback is the (current) lack of a great Zotero citation extension for academic writing."

    "text": "Visual Studio Code and R\n\n\n\nTo get started you will need to download and install Visual Studio Code. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. If you are working on a Mac or Linux, you can install it using Homebrew.\nbrew install --cask visual-studio-code\nOnce you have installed Visual Studio Code, you will want to install the R Extension. You can do this by clicking on the Extensions icon in the left sidebar and searching for “R”.\nYou will need to add the languageserver package in R. You can do this by running the following code in the R console.\ninstall.packages(\"languageserver\")\nNext if you want to use Quarto for literate programming, you should install the Quarto extension. This will allow you to preview your Quarto documents in Visual Studio Code. It also provides syntax highlighting for Quarto documents and suggestions.\nNot a requirement, but I highly recommend installing the Radian console. It is a much better console than the default R console. You can install it by running the following code in a terminal.\npip install -U radian\nIf you plan to use Radian instead of the default R terminal, you will need to know where it is located on your computer. You can find this by running the following code in the terminal.\nwhich radian\nCopy the path to the Radian executable, you will need it later on. It most likely will look something like this.\n/usr/local/bin/radian\nThat’s it! You are now ready to start using and customizing R in Visual Studio Code."

    "text": "Using R in Visual Studio Code\nNow working with R in Visual Studio Code is a little different than working with RStudio with the default setup described in the previous section. To enable the full functionality of R in Visual Studio Code, you will need to change some settings and install some extensions. These are optional, but I highly recommend them.\n\nSettings\nTo change the settings in Visual Studio Code, click on the gear icon in the bottom left corner of the window. This will open the Settings window. You can also open the Settings window by pressing Command + , on a Mac or Ctrl + , on Windows.\nNow you can sift through the settings and change them. Or you can open the JSON file by clicking on the icon in the top right corner of the Settings window. This will open the settings.json file.\nHere are a few settings that I recommend changing.\n\n\nR Terminal\n\nChange the default R terminal to Radian.\nEnable the bracketed paste mode. This will allow you to paste code into the R console without it automatically running. This is useful if you want to paste multiple lines of code into the console at once.\nRemove leading comments from R code. This will remove the # from the beginning of each line of code when you send or paste code.\nUse the httpgd package for viewing plots in a VS Code window or in the browser.\n\nHere are the settings to add to the settings.json file:\n{\n  \"r.rterm.mac\": \"/usr/local/bin/radian\",\n  \"r.bracketedPaste\": true,\n  \"r.removeLeadingComments\": true,\n  \"r.plot.useHttpgd\": true\n}\n\n\nEditor\nThe editor pan is where you will spend most of your time. Some key productivity features to enable are:\n\nEnable word wrap. This will wrap long lines of code so that you don’t have to scroll horizontally.\nEnable formatters for R and Quarto. This will automatically format your code when you save the file, or you can format the code manually by pressing Option + Shift + F on a Mac or Ctrl + Shift + F on Windows.\n\nHere are the settings to add to the settings.json file:\n{\n  \"editor.wordWrap\": \"wordWrapColumn\",\n  \"[r]\": {\n    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"REditorSupport.r\"\n  },\n  \"[quarto]\": {\n    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"quarto.quarto\"\n  }\n}"

This will allow you to clone repositories, create new repositories, commit changes, and push changes to GitHub all from within Visual Studio Code.\nInitializating Git in Visual Studio Code is easy. Just click on the Git icon in the left sidebar and follow the prompts.\nIf you want more functionality, you can install the GitLens extension. This will allow you to see the Git history of a file, see who made changes to a file, and see the changes that were made to a file. If you are new to Git, this is probably more information that you need. But if you are a Git power user, this extension is a must."
